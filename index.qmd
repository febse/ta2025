## GitHub Repository

All course materials are available in the GitHub repository:

[{{< var github >}}]({{< var github >}})


## Software Setup (Recommended)

Please make sure that you have a working [Google](https://www.google.com/) account.

## Software Setup (Local)

First install `git` on your machine: [follow the instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for your operating system. For Windows users,
download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

After installing `git`, open `git bash` and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone {{< var githubHttps >}}
```

The project dependencies are managed via `uv` so you need to install it first: [follow the instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for your operating system.

After installing `uv`, navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run:

```bash
uv sync
```

This will download and install all required packages.

In `VS Code` ([download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), make sure to select the correct Python interpreter: `Ctrl+Shift+P` &rarr; `Python: Select Interpreter` &rarr; `(ta2025) .venv/bin/python`.
When running the notebooks `VS Code` may ask you to select a kernel. Select the same interpreter as above.

The project directory contains a `.vscode/extensions.json` file with recommended extensions for `VS Code`. When the IDE prompts you to install them, please do so.

For `Pycharm` and other IDEs, please refer to their documentation on how to select a Python interpreter.
