    "## Numerical Representations of Text\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen until now, we generally cannot work with text data directly using machine learning algorithms. We need to convert the text into numerical representations first. But this raises several questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to represent text numerically? Our current approach relies on counting words but is this the best way?\n",
    "- What information to keep and what to discard?\n",
    "- How to evaluate the quality of the representation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first approach will be the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model but we want to preview the more modern approaches as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have turned out to be very successful in a wide range of natural language processing tasks (you are likely talking to some form of a transformer almost every day!).\n",
    "\n",
    "These models run on numerical representations of tokens (think about words for now) called embeddings. For example, we can assign each word a vector of 3 numbers (3-dimensional embedding). This is not useful in practice but is easy to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why embeddings are useful is that they fit very well with the computer \n",
    "hardware which is designed to work with numbers (addition, multiplication, etc.)."

    "While the direction of a vector is an instruction of where to go, the magnitude (length) of the vector tells us how far to go in that direction.\n",
