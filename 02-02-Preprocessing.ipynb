    "# Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the task at hand, we may need to preprocess the text data in different ways. There is no universal solution as to how to preprocess text data, as the choice of action is application dependent. Here we will discuss some common preprocessing steps that are often used in text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key consideration here is how to balance the trade-off between the amount of information we want to retain and the dimensionality of the data. The more information we retain, the higher the dimensionality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With high dimensionality\n",
    "    - More data needed\n",
    "    - More computational resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to tokenize text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Words\n",
    "    - Large vocabulary (up to a million words)\n",
    "    - Words convey meaning\n",
    "- Characters\n",
    "    - Smaller vocabulary (up to a few hundred characters) (26 letters in the English alphabet)\n",
    "    - Out-of-vocabulary characters\n",
    "- Subwords\n",
    "    - Medium vocabulary (up to a few thousand subwords)\n",
    "    - Sleep and sleeping are similar\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lowercasing\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple string split will treat `Hello` and `hello` as different words. This may not be desirable in some cases (high dimensionality) and we may want to lowercase all the words. However, in sentiment analysis, the capitalization of words may be important as these are often used to express emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Punctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "Punctuation can be removed or kept. In some cases, punctuation can be important for the meaning of the text. For example, `I am happy` and `I am happy?` may have different meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accent Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Accents can be removed from text data. This is often done in English text data to reduce the dimensionality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopwords are common words that are often removed from text data as these words do not carry much meaning and removing them reduces the dimensionality of the feature space. Examples of stopwords are `the`, `is`, `and`, `but`, `not`, etc. As usual, there is no universal rule as in some cases, these words can be important for the meaning of the text. For example, `not` is a stopword but it can change the meaning of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"I am happy\" vs \"I am not happy\"\n",
    "- \"Problem\" vs \"No problem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with retaining the stopwords is that as they are very common, the vectors representing documents will be mapped close to each other in the feature space. As machine learning models rely on the distance between vectors, this can lead to poor performance.\n"
